## Parallel Development Strategy

### Team Structure
- **Core Platform Team:** Backend services, API gateway, database
- **AI/ML Team:** Orchestrator, tools, Graph-RAG, policy routing
- **Frontend Team:** Web application, shared components, UI/UX
- **Mobile Team:** React Native apps for technician, customer, logistics
- **Domain Team:** PV/BESS/Grid logic, financial models, compliance
- **DevOps Team:** Infrastructure, CI/CD, monitoring, security

### Development Workflow
1. **Feature Branches:** Each team works on feature branches
2. **API-First:** Define OpenAPI specs before implementation
3. **Schema-First:** JSON schemas define all data contracts
4. **Test-Driven:** Unit and integration tests required
5. **Code Reviews:** All changes require peer review
6. **Continuous Integration:** Automated testing and deployment

### Communication & Coordination
- **Daily Standups:** Team-level standups with cross-team sync
- **Weekly Planning:** Cross-team dependency planning
- **Sprint Reviews:** Bi-weekly feature demonstrations
- **Architecture Reviews:** Major design decisions require review

## Risk Management

### Technical Risks
- **Schema Evolution:** Careful versioning of ODL-SD schemas
- **AI Model Costs:** PSU budgeting and model selection
- **Data Consistency:** ACID transactions for critical operations
- **Performance:** Caching strategy for large documents

### Resource Risks
- **Team Dependencies:** Clear API contracts to minimize blocking
- **Skill Gaps:** Training on domain-specific knowledge
- **Timeline Pressure:** Prioritize MVP features first

### Mitigation Strategies
- **Incremental Delivery:** Working features every 2 weeks
- **Fallback Options:** Manual workflows where AI isn't ready
- **Performance Testing:** Load testing from Phase 2
- **Documentation:** Comprehensive technical documentation
